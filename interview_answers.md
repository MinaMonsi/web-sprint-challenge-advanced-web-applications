# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. Explain what a token is used for.
   A token is used in token-based authentication to allow access to an API. Access tokens are received after users successfully authenticate and authorize themselves. Then these tokens are passed as credentials upon calling them.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?
   Web apps can be made secure by using a token-based authentication system. Protected routes can also be added that requrire the user to login before gaining access to the protected page.

3. Describe how web servers work.
   A web server is a computer that stores the code for a website. A server is also a program that runs code on a computer. A physical server is connected to the internet and stores code for websites to share all over the world at all times. When code is loaded onto websites in this manner, the server is hosting the website or app. The server itself needs code to tell it what to do to host the websites. The sofware program used for this is also called a server and it's main purpose is to serve the webpages it reteives for users upon request.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
   POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are the most commonly used HTTP methods. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete operations.

   POST = C POST is used to create new resources.
   GET = R GET is used to read data and not change it. It can be called without modifiying or corrupting the data.
   PUT = U in CRUD. We use the PUT method to update information.
   PATCH = U PATCH resembles PUT, but contains instructions on how to modify changes to the resource.
   DELETE = D DELETE instructs the server to remove information from somewhere.
